# [First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/september-leetcoding-challenge/558/week-5-september-29th-september-30th/3478/)

Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
```

**Follow up:**

Your algorithm should run in _O(n)_ time and uses constant extra space.

**Hint #1**
Think about how you would solve the problem in non-constant space. Can you apply that logic to the existing space?

**Hint #2**
We don't care about duplicates or non-positive integers

**Hint #3**
Remember that O(2n) = O(n)
