# [Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/august-leetcoding-challenge/550/week-2-august-8th-august-14th/3423/)

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Note:**

Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

**Example:**

```
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7
```

**Explanation:**
One longest palindrome that can be built is `"dccaccd"`, whose length is `7`.
